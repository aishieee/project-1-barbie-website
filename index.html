                <h3>The creation of Barbie </h3>
                <p>Ruth Handler created the iconic Barbie doll, inspired by her daughter Barbara. Ruth observed
                    Barbara and her friends using baby dolls to role-play adult scenarios. She noticed that in the
                    1950s, there was no representation of adult female bodies except for the Bild Lilli doll, which
                    had bulging breasts and was commonly sold in tobacco shops, bars, and adult stores. These
                    controversial dolls were marketed primarily towards men as gag gifts at bachelor parties or
                    suggestive mementos. Bild Lilli dolls served as the inspiration for the globally recognised
                    Barbie brand.</p>

            <p>On March 9th, 1959, the first Barbie doll was introduced, adapted from the Bild Lilli doll, three years
                after Ruth purchased three of these dolls for her daughter Barbara. The Barbie doll wore a black and
                white striped bathing suit, making it the first adult doll whose appearance was controversially popular
                with children.</p>

                prestigious sectors. Her career trajectory is a triumph of feminist ambition!</p>

                <p>Today, <span>Barbie</span> has inspired generations of women by showcasing dolls dressed in all sorts
                    of
                    <em>cool careers,</em> as seen in picture 1. But Barbie doesn't stop there! She's spreading her
                    magic
                    through charity with the <span>'Close the Dream Gap'</span> project (check out picture 2). This
                    amazing
                    initiative aims to bridge the gap between girls and their full potential. How awesome is that?</p>
                <p>Barbie is all about <em>inclusivity</em> too! As the biggest doll brand out there, Barbie celebrates
                    representation with a dazzling array of careers, skin tones, body types, sexualities, and even
                    disabilities (scroll to picture 3 for proof). It's no wonder that every young person can find
                    inspiration in a Barbie dollâ€”something so important in today's world.</p>
                <p>And here's a fun tidbit: in picture 4, you'll see <span>Margot Robbie</span> as Barbie in the 2023
                    live-action movie. The cast had a blast raising money on set by 'fining' anyone who didn't wear
                    pink. It
                    was all in good fun, with the money collected going to charity. <em>Pink power for a great
                        cause!</em>
