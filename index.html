                    <h3>The creation of Barbie </h3>
                    <p>Ruth Handler created the iconic Barbie doll, inspired by her daughter Barbara. Ruth observed Barbara and her friends using baby dolls to role-play adult scenarios. She noticed that in the 1950s, there was no representation of adult female bodies except for the Bild Lilli doll, which had bulging breasts and was commonly sold in tobacco shops, bars, and adult stores. These controversial dolls were marketed primarily towards men as gag gifts at bachelor parties or suggestive mementos. Bild Lilli dolls served as the inspiration for the globally recognised Barbie brand.</p>
