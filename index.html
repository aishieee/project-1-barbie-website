                <h3>The Creation Of Barbie</h3>
                <p>Ruth Handler created the iconic Barbie doll, inspired by her daughter Barbara. Ruth observed Barbara
                    and her friends using baby dolls to role-play adult scenarios. She noticed that in the 1950s, there
                    was no representation of adult female bodies except for the Bild Lilli doll, which had bulging
                    breasts and was commonly sold in tobacco shops, bars, and adult stores. These controversial dolls
                    were marketed primarily towards men as gag gifts at bachelor parties or suggestive mementos. Bild
                    Lilli dolls served as the inspiration for the globally recognised Barbie brand.</p>

                        magic through charity with the <span>'Close the Dream Gap'</span> project (check out picture 2).
                        This amazing initiative aims to bridge the gap between girls and their full potential. How awesome
                        is that?</p>
                    <p>Barbie is all about <em>inclusivity</em> too! As the biggest doll brand out there, Barbie celebrates
                        representation with a dazzling array of careers, skin tones, body types, sexualities, and even
                        disabilities (scroll to picture 3 for proof). It's no wonder that every young person can find
                        inspiration in a Barbie dollâ€”something so important in today's world.</p>
                    <p>And here's a fun tidbit: in picture 4, you'll see <span>Margot Robbie</span> as Barbie in the 2023
                        live-action movie. The cast had a blast raising money on set by 'fining' anyone who didn't wear
                        pink. It was all in good fun, with the money collected going to charity. <em>Pink power for a great
                            cause!</em></p>
