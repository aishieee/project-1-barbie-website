                On March 9th, 1959, the first Barbie doll was introduced, adapted from the Bild Lilli doll, three years
            after Ruth purchased three of these dolls for her daughter Barbara. The Barbie doll wore a black and
            white striped bathing suit, making it the first adult doll whose appearance was controversially popular
            with children.
